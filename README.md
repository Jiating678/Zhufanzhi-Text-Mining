# Zhufanzhi-Text-Mining
This project involves text mining of the Zhu Fan Zhi, a historical document from the Song Dynasty. The goal is to analyze and extract meaningful insights from the text, focusing on cultural and geographical references. This work aims to contribute to the understanding of Southeast Asian interactions during that period.
